## Overview

Seoul-Bites is a comprehensive web project designed to provide an engaging digital presence for a modern Korean restaurant. The project focuses on bridging the gap between traditional culinary branding and modern digital standards. By utilizing HTML5 semantic tags and responsive design principles, the site ensures that the "flavors of Korea" are accessible across all devices, from high-resolution desktops to mobile smartphones.

## Key Features

- **Semantic Content Structure**: Utilizes HTML5 elements (like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`) to improve SEO and accessibility, ensuring a clean and meaningful document structure.
- **Dynamic Menu Presentation**: Features a responsive multi-page layout that highlights signature Korean dishes, chef specials, and traditional favorites with a clean, modern aesthetic.
- **Responsive Navigation**: A fully adaptable navigation system that seamlessly transitions between a multi-link desktop header and a compact, mobile-friendly menu for on-the-go users.
- **Aesthetic Branding Integration**: Designed to support "Instagrammable" and visually attractive presentations, aligning digital design with the restaurant’s physical branding and eco-friendly packaging themes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For building a solid, semantic foundation that supports modern web standards.
- **CSS3 (Layouts & Animations)**: Leveraged Flexbox and CSS Grid to create complex, multi-column layouts that remain fluid across different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: The backbone of the project’s responsive strategy, ensuring a high-quality user experience regardless of device orientation or resolution.
- **Web Design Principles**: Focused on visual consistency, utilizing appropriate color spaces and typography to reflect authentic Korean culture and innovation.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the primary challenges was maintaining visual consistency while transitioning from a dense, image-heavy desktop menu to a streamlined mobile experience. This required a deep dive into CSS Grid to reorder and stack elements without losing the "premium taste" appeal of the digital storefront. Additionally, the project provided valuable insights into how web accessibility impacts the "discoverability" of a niche culinary brand in a competitive digital market.

## Outcome

The resulting Seoul-Bites website serves as a high-quality digital showcase that enhances customer engagement and trust. By adhering to modern web development principles, the project successfully creates a professional and "budget-friendly" digital solution that can be easily updated with seasonal specials or chef recommendations. This project highlights the effectiveness of using standard web technologies to build impactful, brand-focused platforms.
