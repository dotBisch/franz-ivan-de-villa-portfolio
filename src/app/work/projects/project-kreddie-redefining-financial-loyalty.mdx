## Overview

This phase of Project Kreddie focused exclusively on the discovery and formulation of the core problems within the Home Credit Philippines ecosystem. The research aimed to understand why a market leader with millions of users struggled to maintain long-term emotional loyalty beyond transactional utility. By utilizing deep-dive UX research and behavioral analysis, we identified the psychological and structural barriers that prevent underbanked users from viewing the app as a lifelong financial partner.

## Problem Formulation & Research Insights

### 1. The Transactional "Ghost Town" Effect
The primary challenge identified was that Home Credit is viewed strictly as a "utility" app. Users engage with the platform only when they need immediate cash or are required to make a payment. Once the loan is cleared, the emotional connection terminates, leading to high churn rates and frequent app uninstallation.

### 2. High Anxiety & Rejection Shame
The research uncovered significant "rejection shame" among Filipino borrowers. Users are often overwhelmed by generic product lists and fear applying for items they cannot afford, leading to a "desire-budget disconnect". This anxiety is compounded by fears of hidden fees, penalties, and unpredictable future cash flow.

### 3. Rigid & Depersonalized Collection Systems
Current debt recovery methods were found to be binary and abrasive. Users reported feeling harassed by aggressive, "one-size-fits-all" calls that ignore real-life emergencies (e.g., medical crises or delayed salaries). This lack of empathy results in users being 28% less likely to remain loyal after a negative interaction.

### 4. Cultural & Social Isolation
Despite the deeply communal nature of Filipino culture (Bayanihan and Barkada), the current digital experience is entirely isolated. There is a lack of social reinforcement or community-based trust models, which are the traditional ways Filipinos make financial decisions offline.

## Research Methodologies

- **User Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzed thousands of data points from app reviews and online forums to categorize recurring emotional triggers.
- **Persona Development**: Created "Ate Maria," a striving breadwinner persona, to anchor the research in the lived experience of the Class C & D demographic.
- **Market Benchmarking**: Evaluated the "Sachet Mentality" (Tingi culture) and digital wallet adoption rates (~87%) to understand local spending rhythms.
- **Competitive Gap Analysis**: Identified that while competitors offer credit, none address the emotional and communal needs of the underbanked.

## Key Learning

The core problem is not a lack of access to credit, but a **Relationship Gap**. The research demonstrated that for a fintech app to achieve true loyalty, it must move away from fear-based, penalty-driven interactions and move toward a model that respects user dignity and cultural context.
