## Overview

Azure Haven is a comprehensive hotel booking platform built with Laravel. The project emphasizes clean architecture, modular code organization, and a secure, user-friendly interface for both guests and administrators.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure registration, login, and role-based access using Laravel Fortify and Jetstream.
- **Room Management**: Admin panel for managing room types, availability, and pricing.
- **Booking System**: Real-time room booking with calendar integration and automated email notifications.
- **Responsive Front-End**: Custom HTML/CSS templates for public pages and admin dashboard, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for bookings, user management, and room data, supporting integration with external services or mobile apps.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance**: PHPUnit-based test suite for both unit and feature testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: PHP framework for backend logic, routing, and ORM.
- **PHP**: Core programming language.
- **Blade**: Laravel’s templating engine for dynamic views.
- **Tailwind CSS & PostCSS**: For modern, utility-first styling.
- **Vite**: For fast asset bundling and hot module replacement.
- **MySQL**: Relational database for persistent storage.
- **Composer & NPM**: Dependency management for PHP and JS packages.

## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was designing a flexible booking system that could handle real-time availability and prevent double bookings. This required careful database design and transaction management. Integrating custom front-end templates with Laravel’s Blade engine and ensuring consistent styling with Tailwind CSS was also a learning experience. The project reinforced the importance of automated testing and modular code structure for maintainability.

## Outcome

Azure Haven is now a fully functional hotel booking platform, supporting both guest-facing and admin operations. The modular architecture allows for easy feature expansion, and the robust test suite ensures reliability. The project serves as a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as payment integration or third-party API connections.
